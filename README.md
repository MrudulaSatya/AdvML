Project 1 -  Determining Probabilities of Handwriting Formations using PGMs

Learning basics of Bayesian Networks by applying it on Handwritten "th" data and determining the most probable setting of features for "th".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project 2 - Modified the Pix2Pix modelâ€™s objective function to get better visual results for generalized image-to-image translation.

Tested on Day-to-Night task using a standard dataset used in the original Pix2Pix paper.

Files -

1. OriginalPix2Pix - the implementation of the orginal pix2pix model
2. ModifiedPix2Pix - the implementation of the modified pix2pix that has the complete modified objective function (modification done by me)
3. ModifiedPix2Pix_RecOnly - the implementation of modified pix2pix that has only reconstruction loss in the objective function  (modification done by me)
4. EvaluationMetrics - the implementation of the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the results
5. proj3report - the report of the entire project including the results.
